# esp8266_blink

esp8266 led example blink
Welcome to the esp8266_blink wiki!
Beginning Internet of Things Projects using Arduino, NodeMCU ESP8266
The introduction of NodeMCU esp8266 connect with LED sensor using Arduino IDE
Node MCU with LEDThis example is using necessary things as below.
Nodemcu esp8266 all version
LED 1 each : + to D1
connecting LED as picture above

Any more important than anythings is download Arduino IDE Software

1. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
After we finished downloading and installation then
Open the program Arduino IDE Software

choose File -> KEY ⌘+N

2. Download ESP8266 Library https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
Arduino -> Preferences
Looking at Additional Boards Manager URLs :
Put this link http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
then click OK button

3. You can install several sensor and Board library by using Board Manager
Firstly we should install NodeMCU or ESP8266 library that we put link of database from GitHub before.
Go to Tools -> Board -> Board Manager
See two pictures show as below to easy understand

Tools -> Board Choose Boards ManagerClick Install buttonClick install button and waiting for installation about 10 minutes

4. Download USB to TTL Driver http://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html

5. Use microUSB connect to the computer then make sure that my computer already known our NodeMCU
Go to Tools -> Port USB or Port
So now we see /dev/cu.usbmodem…
we hi-light or click at /dev/cu.usbmodem…

From the step 3 we install library of NodeMCU or ESP8266 finished.
We should choose Board Controller to NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)
In this step if we can not see ESP8266 Module it's mean we fail to install at step 3 the solution is we should reinstall again

6. Choose File -> Examples -> ESP8266 -> Blink
This example making blink LED Built in on Broad

From Coding at above picture We replace and put more coding
Put define at the top

#define LED_PIN D1

7. Replace LED_BUILTIN to LED_PIN
The reason is because we connect external LED to D1 and we want it blink
